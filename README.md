Approaching software design: I focus on defining clear requirements, modularizing components, and using iterative prototyping.
New design skills: This project enhanced my ability to incorporate user interactivity and apply physics principles in visual design.
Design process: I followed an iterative approach, starting with basic functionality and incrementally adding features based on feedback.
Future application of tactics: Iterative refinement and modularization ensure scalable and maintainable designs for future projects.
Developing programs: I emphasize structured planning, incremental implementation, and testing throughout development.
New development strategies: For this 3D scene, I used real-time debugging and enhanced visual feedback to improve responsiveness.
Iteration in development: Regular testing and adjustments were essential to refine interactions and ensure seamless functionality.
Evolving approach: Over time, I adopted better debugging practices, reusable code patterns, and enhanced interactivity to complete the project efficiently.
Computer science for goals: It equips me with problem-solving skills and tools to build solutions that align with my professional and personal aspirations.
Educational application of computational graphics: These skills provide a foundation for advanced visualization and analytical projects in academia.
Professional application of computational graphics: They enable me to create engaging, interactive tools for fields like gaming, simulations, or data visualization.
